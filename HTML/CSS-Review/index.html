            <h2>My Assessment</h2>
            <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not
                the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is
                intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex
                relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of
                data.</p>
            <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and
                presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of
                data, as simplification usually does.</p>
            <p> Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to
                accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather
                than the illumination of it.</p>

            <h2>Questions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b> Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute.</b></li>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The "alt" attribute (short for alternative text) is used to provide a textual description of an image, primarily for accessibility purposes. It's essential for users who may not be able to view the image due to various reasons such as slow internet connection, browser settings, or visual impairments. Search engines also rely on alt text to understand and index images.
                    The "title" attribute, on the other hand, is used to provide additional information about an element, such as an image, when the user hovers over it. It's often used for supplementary information or tooltips. Unlike the alt attribute, the title attribute is not primarily intended for accessibility purposes, although it can still enhance user experience. Additionally, search engines typically do not use the title attribute for indexing purposes. </p>    
                <li><b>Please provide an example of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary below.</b></li>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> To mark up a definition from the dictionary, we can use HTML's <b>dfn</b> (Definition) element. Here's an example using the word "computer" as the definition:<br>
                    <b>Example:</b>The <dfn>computer</dfn> is an electronic device that can perform various tasks by executing pre-programmed instructions.<br>
                    In the above example, The <b>'dfn'</b> element is used to define the term "computer". The content within the <b>'dfn'</b> tags is the actual definition of the term.

                <li><b>Please provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site.</b></li>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> Sure, here's the link pointing to my favorite website: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" title="Visit my favorite website">Overleaf</a></p>
            </ol>
